# TRON

The code implements the TRON game, which is based on the TRON Film. <br> 
To start the game, just run the main.py with Python.


## About the Game

It's a snake-like game where you have to control a bike with a tail. You die, if you drive in the tail of an enemy or in the border of the field. The goal is to be the last driver surviving. <br>
<br>
There are different game modes implemented:
- Tron against AI
- Tron against a local player
- A classic Snake game mode
- A special Power-Up mode
<br>
There is a guide on how to play the game as a PDF in the repository, but it is only available in German. <br>


## Background Information
This was my first-ever project in Python and also my first "bigger" project. <br>
I wrote this for a course at university. The task was to implement the Tron game with the different game modes in Python over the time of a semester. <br>
The code is unchanged since submitting it for the correction.
